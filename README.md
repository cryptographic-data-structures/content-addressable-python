Content Addressable Data Structures in Python
===

Content Addressable data structures are a subset of cryptographic
data structures that can be addressed using hashes, digests, and
certificates based on the content of the data held in the data
structure.

A change to the contents of the data structure represents a change
to the address of the entire structure.

This project will demonstrate the construction of such data structures.

Associated projects will provide demonstration of the utility of such
structures in distributed systems.
